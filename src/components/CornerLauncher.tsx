/**
 * The corner launcher: ONE block in the bottom-right corner, split down the
 * middle into PLAY (left) and CHAT (right).
 *
 * The twin of website-city's `CornerLauncher` (`src/app/_components/lib/
 * corner_launcher.tsx`) — the two shells sit on the same domain, so a reader who
 * walks from a landing page into the app must not find the same control in a
 * different place, or wearing a different coat. Keep them in step, and keep the
 * stylesheet (`src/styles/components/CornerLauncher.css`, copied from city's) in
 * step with it too.
 *
 * ONE DIFFERENCE, and it is forced: city's chat half is a BUTTON that opens the
 * chat panel in place, which needs a session, a tRPC client and a socket. This
 * is a static Astro build with none of the three, so here the chat half is a
 * plain link to `/messages` — the page city's panel is a shortcut to. Same
 * corner, same colour, same glyph; it just takes you to the conversation instead
 * of bringing the conversation to you. For the same reason there is no unread
 * badge and no signed-out state: nothing here knows either.
 *
 * Both halves are icon-only squares. The label lives in `aria-label`/`title`
 * rather than beside the glyph: this sits over the page on every route, at every
 * width, and a word inside it is a word that has to be translated, has to fit,
 * and pushes the block wider on exactly the phone screens with the least room
 * for it.
 *
 * Rendered WITHOUT a `client:*` directive — it is two links and a CSS
 * animation, so it ships as static HTML and no JavaScript at all.
