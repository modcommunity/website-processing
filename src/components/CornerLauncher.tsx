/**
 * The corner launcher: ONE block in the bottom-right corner — the wide PLAY
 * button, with CONSOLE and CHAT as squares beside it.
 *
 * The twin of website-city's `CornerLauncher` (`src/app/_components/lib/
 * corner_launcher.tsx`) — the two shells sit on the same domain, so a reader who
 * walks from a landing page into the app must not find the same control in a
 * different place, or wearing a different coat. Keep them in step, and keep the
 * stylesheet (`src/styles/components/CornerLauncher.css`, copied from city's) in
 * step with it too.
 *
 * WHAT THIS BLOCK IS A SLICE OF. Over there it is the friends card: who is
 * online, one press to invite them, and this row as its footer. The rows need a
 * session, a tRPC client and a presence poll, none of which a static Astro build
 * has, so what renders here is the FOOTER ALONE — at city's card width, so the
 * three controls land on exactly the same pixels on both halves of the domain.
 * Crossing over, the block simply grows upward.
 *
 * EVERY CONTROL IS A LINK, which is the other forced difference. City's chat and
 * console halves are toggles that open a panel in place; here they are addresses
 * — `/messages` and `/console`, the pages those panels are shortcuts to. And
 * because a panel can be opened over a sign-in dialog but a static page cannot,
 * the signed-out state is a link to `/login` rather than city's modal. The cookie
 * hint (`lib/auth-hint`) is all this side knows: a yes/no, no identity, so there
 * is no unread badge and no pressed state either.
 *
 * The two squares are greyed signed-out, exactly as city greys them — the
 * feature must stay visible to the people who have not signed up for it — but
 * they keep an ordinary pointer and a "Sign in" title, because unlike city's
 * disabled-looking button this one really does go somewhere.
 *
 * Play carries its label; the squares do not. A word inside a control that sits
 * over the page on every route at every width is a word that has to be
 * translated, has to fit, and pushes the block wider on exactly the phone
 * screens with the least room for it — and city labels the same one and only
 * one.
 *
 * Hydrated (`client:idle` in `Layout.astro`), which it did not used to be: the
 * signed-in coat is read from the cookie after mount. First paint is the
 * signed-out state on both server and client, so there is nothing for hydration
 * to disagree about.
