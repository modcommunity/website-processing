 * Header primary nav — a mirror of website-city's `PRIMARY_NAV`: the same four

 * sub-labels. Labels/descriptions come from `nav.*`, ported verbatim from
 * city's `locales/<lang>/nav.json`, so both headers read identically in every
 * locale.
 *
 * The bar is four entries wide, exactly as city's is: everything you can BROWSE
 * under Explore, everywhere the community talks to us under Community, what we
 * publish back at them under Resources, and the Blog on its own. Resources is
 * hrefless (a dropdown-only trigger) because it has no page of its own; Explore
 * has none either, so it points at the app browser, exactly as city's does.
 *
 * The pillars no longer carry their sidebar section as a dropdown — city
 * dropped that, so the per-pillar Add / Browse / My X routes are reached from
 * the landing page or the rail, which still lists every section in full. That
 * is also why nothing here is signed-in-only any more: the auth hint still
 * shapes the RAIL (see `buildVisibleSidebarSections`), just not this.
 *
 * If city's PRIMARY_NAV changes, change this with it — that config is the
 * source of truth.

 *    name and an app has nothing to submit to — the dedicated page (which city
