/**
 * Header primary nav — a mirror of website-city's `PRIMARY_NAV`: the same four
 * top-level entries, in the same order, with the same icons and the same
 * sub-labels. Labels/descriptions come from `nav.*`, ported verbatim from
 * city's `locales/<lang>/nav.json`, so both headers read identically in every
 * locale.
 *
 * The bar is four entries wide, exactly as city's is: everything you can BROWSE
 * under Explore, everywhere the community talks to us under Community, what we
 * publish back at them under Resources, and the Blog on its own. Resources is
 * hrefless (a dropdown-only trigger) because it has no page of its own; Explore
 * points at `/explore`, city's editorial front across every content type.
 *
 * The pillars no longer carry their sidebar section as a dropdown — city
 * dropped that, so the per-pillar Add / Browse / My X routes are reached from
 * the landing page or the rail, which still lists every section in full. That
 * is also why nothing here is signed-in-only any more: the auth hint still
 * shapes the RAIL (see `buildVisibleSidebarSections`), just not this.
 *
 * If city's PRIMARY_NAV changes, change this with it — that config is the
 * source of truth. That includes the ORDER of the pillars, which had drifted:
 * this menu led with mods and put collections ahead of communities, so the front
 * page's own index of the same destinations was numbered differently from the
 * menu above it.

/**
 * Primary sidebar sections — a mirror of website-city's `SIDEBAR_SECTIONS`
 * (`src/app/_components/ui/shell/nav-config.ts`), which is the source of truth
 * for the entries, their order and their icons. Labels come from `rail.*`,
 * ported verbatim from city's `locales/<lang>/nav.json`.
 *
 * Three deliberate differences from city, all of them structural rather than
 * editorial:
 *
 * 1. **No Admin section.** City role-gates it to staff; the `tmc_auth` cookie
 *    carries a yes/no and no role, so there is nothing to gate on here. Staff
 *    reach `/admin` from the app.
 * 2. **"Add" leaves are plain links to the dedicated `/{plural}/add` pages.**
 *    In city they are buttons that open a create pop-up in place. This is a
 *    static build with no session and no tRPC client, so a pop-up asking for a
 *    name and an app has nothing to submit to — the dedicated page (which city
 *    already had behind every one of those modals) is the working destination.
 *    The same reasoning applies to the "Share your work" call-to-action, which
 *    points at `/share`.
 * 3. **No Legal section.** City has none either; ToS / Privacy / Licenses are
 *    footer links in both shells.

/**
 * {@link buildSidebarSections} reduced to the plain shared contract: the

 * — which is ours, not the shared type's — is stripped off the rest.
 *
 * Every surface that renders the rail's sections (the desktop rail, the mobile
 * drawer, the header's pillar dropdowns) goes through this, so none of them can
 * offer a destination the others hide.
