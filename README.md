The official landing page for [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com) utilizing [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)!

This is a *work-in-progress*!

## Running
Here are commands you can use to run the web server through Astro (for developer use).

```bash
# Clone this repository.
git clone https://github.com/modcommunity/website-processing

# Change directory.
cd website-processing

# Install packages.
npm install

# Run Astro's dev server available on port 4321 by default.
# NOTE - You can pass `-- --host <address>` to listen on specific IP addresses (or all with 0.0.0.0).
# EX: npm astro dev -- --host 0.0.0.0
npm run dev
```

If you want to run this application in production, I recommend looking into [Docker](https://docs.astro.build/en/recipes/docker/).
